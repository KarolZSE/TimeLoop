# TimeLoop
Pilot you have a new mission! Your target? Eliminate all of the red planes. How to do it? You just have to cut their trail in a specified amount of time, but be careful you will lose if they cut yours. That's all. Be brave! You know what they say the biggest enemy is your past! - In this simple game your goal is to destroy the enemy spaceships - the catch? The enemy is your past ;)

This game is my first project in Phaser, It was a lot of pain in my butt, The Game still has some bugs - The continue after death button likes to make a lot off them. It took me 30+ hours, most of this time spend on recording module for enemies, I hope you will like this game.

# In simple terms:
- You have to go through the enemy trail.
- If the enemy goes through your trail you lose.
- You have a timer if it reaches 0 you also lose.
- If you lose your score goes in to the database (leaderboard for everyone to see.)
- So good luck and even bigger scores!

# What's new?
- I have addressed the performance issues. Right now, I could run it even on virtual machines, and I have fixed several bugs that were affecting stability and speed.
- Added a function that spawns your based on the location of the enemies.
- Various fixes around the timer.
